# DevConnector 

 Social network for developers

This is a MERN stack application from the "MERN Stack Front To Back". It is a small social network app that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.

# Quick Start ðŸš€

### Add a default.json file in config folder with the following


{
  "mongoURI": "<your_mongoDB_Atlas_uri_with_credentials>",
  "jwtSecret": "secret",
  "githubToken": "<yoursecrectaccesstoken>"
}
### Install server dependencies

npm install


### Install client dependencies


cd client
npm install


### Run both Express & React from root


npm run dev


### Build for production

cd client
npm run build


### Test production before deploy

After running a build in the client ðŸ‘†, cd into the root of the project.  
And run...

Linux/Unix

```bash
NODE_ENV=production node server.js
```

Windows Cmd Prompt or Powershell

```bash
$env:NODE_ENV="production"
node server.js
```

Check in browser on [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)

### Deploy to Heroku

If you followed the sensible advice above and included `config/default.json` and `config/production.json` in your .gitignore file, then pushing to Heroku will omit your config files from the push.  
However, Heroku needs these files for a successful build.  
So how to get them to Heroku without commiting them to GitHub?

What I suggest you do is create a local only branch, lets call it _production_.

```bash
git checkout -b production
```

We can use this branch to deploy from, with our config files.

Add the config file...

```bash
git add -f config/production.json
```

This will track the file in git on this branch only. **DON'T PUSH THE PRODUCTION BRANCH TO GITHUB**

Commit...

```bash
git commit -m 'ready to deploy'
```
